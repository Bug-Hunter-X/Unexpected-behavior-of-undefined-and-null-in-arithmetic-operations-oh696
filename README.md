This repository demonstrates an uncommon JavaScript bug related to the behavior of `undefined` and `null` in arithmetic operations. Specifically, adding `undefined` to a number results in `NaN`, while adding `null` to a number results in the number itself. This behavior can be unexpected and lead to subtle bugs in code. The `bug.js` file demonstrates the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` shows a possible solution.  The solution involves explicit checks for null or undefined values before performing arithmetic operations.
